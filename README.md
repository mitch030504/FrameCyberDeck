VR CyberDeck is a cross-platform desktop deck for sideloading content to Android and Meta Quest devices, wrapped in a neon terminal aesthetic that doesn't feel like a 2014 sideloader. Use it as a pure sideloader out of the box, or add your own server for a browsable library.

## `// FORK_NOTE`

VR CyberDeck started as a fork of **ApprenticeVR** by **jimzrt**. The core engine — ADB control, the download/upload pipeline, rclone integration, library connection — is theirs. Everything below the surface is a heavy rewrite of the _experience_:

|                  | ApprenticeVR                                              | VR CyberDeck                                                                      |

| **Theme**        | Stock Fluent UI                                           | Fully optional cyberpunk / neon-terminal rebrand                                  |
| **Onboarding**   | Hardcoded (original) /Configure server before use (forks) | Easily configure an rclone config or json file                                    |

| **Console**      | None                                                      | In-header Hacker Console + ADB Shell with quick-command shortcuts and user macros |

| **Downloads**    | Sequential                                                | Up to **5 concurrent**, with NEW / UPDATED badges                                 |

## `// FEATURES`

**`[ LIBRARY ]`** — optional, only when you add a server

- Sideloader-first: works on first launch with zero config; a library is entirely opt-in
- Add your own server under **Manage Remotes** (a server config or an rclone config) to unlock a browsable library
- Card view + table view, persistent sort, size presets, 18+ filter
- Table view stretches to fill the window so wide screens aren't wasted
- `NEW` / `UPDATED` badges driven off real `lastUpdated` timestamps

// NOTE: `NEW` = added to the library in the last 30 days. `UPDATED` = existing game updated in the last 7 days. Both badges can appear on the same title simultaneously.

**`[ TRANSFERS ]`**

- Up to 5 parallel downloads with live progress
- Live `// TRANSFER_BUS` strip in the header — rotates through active transfers with name, stage, %, speed, and ETA
- Unified Transfers drawer with stage-aware labels (`Installing APK...`, `Copying OBB...`)
- Scan existing downloads folder and reconcile against the library
- Clear-completed, retry, and per-item delete actions
- Close the window mid-transfer? Cyberdeck warns you with `[ TRANSFERS IN PROGRESS ]` before letting you bail (works for both X and Cmd+Q on macOS)

**`[ DEVICE / ADB ]`**

- Auto-connect Quest on launch
- ADB Shell dialog with built-in **quick-command shortcuts**:
  - `PERFORMANCE` — pin CPU/GPU level, swap refresh rate (72/90/120Hz), reset texture
  - `UPDATES` — block / unblock the OS updater and Meta Store
  - `SYSTEM` — reboot variants, battery, storage, wifi, IP, proximity toggle
  - `PACKAGES` — list 3rd-party / all / current focused app
  - `WIRELESS` — `tcpip 5555`, `adb devices`
- **Custom user macros** — define your own labelled shortcut for any command you spam (right-click to edit/delete, persisted across sessions)
- Disable-sideloading toggle for safety
- WiFi bookmarks for wireless ADB

**`[ TRAILERS ]`**

- Locked-down `youtube-nocookie.com/embed/` player — no ads, no suggested videos, no subscribe button, no comments, no end-screen "Watch next" grid
- Autoplays as soon as you open the trailer drawer

**`[ INTERFACE ]`**

- Glitch boot intro, neon Hacker Console, themed dialogs top to bottom
- Compact laptop-friendly header — drops down to a 900x640 min window
- Dark mode done right (no half-themed popups)
- Accent color picker, tab memory
- **Font picker** — swap Courier New for Console / Terminal / System Mono if the default is hard to read
- **Optional sound effects** — drop `click.wav`, `type.wav`, or `matrix.wav` into your user-data `sounds/` folder (or `resources/sounds/` for bundled), and the UI plays them on button clicks, the boot intro typing, and the ADB shell matrix load. Toggle + volume in Settings, with a per-file "✓ READY / — missing" status readout.
- Colorblind mode now covers the whole UI — version subtitles, filter counters, Transfers button, battery pill, breach animation all swap palette
- Font scale up to 200%
- One-click log upload from Settings → Log Upload

## `// DOWNLOAD`

| File                                  | Platform            |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `vr-cyberdeck-x.x.x-x64.dmg`          | macOS x64           |
| `vr-cyberdeck-x.x.x-arm64.dmg`        | macOS arm64         |
| `vr-cyberdeck-x.x.x-setup-x64.exe`    | Windows — Installer |
| `vr-cyberdeck-x.x.x-portable-x64.exe` | Windows — Portable  |
| `vr-cyberdeck-x.x.x-x86_64.AppImage`  | Linux x64           |
| `vr-cyberdeck-x.x.x-arm64.AppImage`   | Linux ARM64         |
| `vr-cyberdeck-x.x.x-amd64.deb`        | Debian/Ubuntu x64   |
| `vr-cyberdeck-x.x.x-arm64.deb`        | Debian/Ubuntu ARM64 |

Always grab the latest release. If it's already installed, just update in-app.

**macOS — "App is damaged":**

```
xattr -c /Applications/VR\ CyberDeck.app
```

**Linux AppImage:**

```
chmod +x vr-cyberdeck-x.x.x-x86_64.AppImage
./vr-cyberdeck-x.x.x-x86_64.AppImage
```

**Linux — Quest only connects after accepting the "Allow access to data" prompt:**

Linux needs a udev rule before ADB can reach the headset (Windows gets this from its driver). If the Quest shows up as **NO USB ACCESS**, click **FIX USB ACCESS** on its card, or run:

```
sh scripts/linux-quest-udev.sh
```

Then unplug and replug the Quest. After that it connects as soon as it's plugged in, and you can dismiss the data prompt.

---

## `// JACK_IN`

1. Install the build for your OS
2. Plug in your Quest via USB (data-capable cable)
3. Allow USB Debugging on the headset
4. Drag an APK, ZIP, game folder, or OBB folder onto the deck to sideload it

That's it — no account, no server, no JSON to edit.

> Want a browsable library instead? Add an authorized server config or rclone config under **Manage Remotes**. Other advanced flows live in **Other Settings**.

> Power user? Open the **ADB Shell** right from the deck — the shortcut panel above the terminal covers most Quest tweaks in one click, and you can save your own commands as `MY MACROS` pills.

## `// FEEDBACK`

Found a bug? Got an idea? Want to swap notes with other CyberDeck users?

- **[Open an issue](https://github.com/mitch030504/FrameCyberDeck/issues/new)** for crashes, broken downloads, Steam Frame deployment issues, or anything that looks wrong. Include a log file when possible.

If you've got a sound clip you think would suit the UI (terminal click, mechanical keyboard tap, matrix-style hum), open an issue — happy to bundle community favourites in a later build.

---

## `// BUILD_FROM_SOURCE`

Frame CyberDeck builds and runs in local sideloader mode without a vrSrc API key.

```sh
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
```

To build an installable package:

| Platform | Command             |
| -------- | ------------------- |
| Windows  | `npm run build:win:x64` |
| macOS    | `npm run build:mac:x64` |
| Linux    | `npm run build:linux:x64` |

An authorized catalog key is optional and should never be committed. For development it can be supplied at runtime with `FRAME_CYBERDECK_API_KEY`.
